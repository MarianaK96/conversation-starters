I need to ONLY map over the items that belong to a certain category 
Use the new array created by filter to map over for the slideshow 

  const filterCategory = (category) => {
      const newItems = items.filter((item) => item.category === category); 
      setCards(newItems)
  };
        - this needs to be in the same component as the card setup - have it in the home component and then pass it down to card setup?

how will this work? I am not returning a component with all the menu items, I just want to create a new array with them

but I am not mapping over the array when I set up the cards...I am simply using state to flick through them 
- how do I know which data to flick through? I use the array of cardData...so set up a new array and set state to that 

Filtering works!!!
Now I need to make sure that the checkNumber function is working

(css - different color for the different cards?)

TO-DO 
-have the starter card as the only thing visible until someone clicks on one of the categories - how would I do this?
-have the card as a different component set to position absolute infront of the other cards, 

-push the main page to the side when opening up the sidebar BUT this means that the useState will have 
to start in the home page which I then pass into SideBar (that's all)
